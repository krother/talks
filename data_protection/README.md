# Data Protection Fundamentals

**a workshop for big and small groups**

## Goal

**Participants become aware of data protection in their organisation.**

During the workshop, participants learn fundamental vocabulary about GDPR.
The common experience during the exercise helps them to communicate GDPR issues together in the future.
The workshop does not provide legal advice. This has to be stated clearly.

## Lesson Plan

==== =========================== ====
step name                        time
==== =========================== ====
1    Welcome                     2'
2    Data Protection Quiz        25'
3    Go through answers          25'
4    Mind Map                    5'
5    Reflection questions        25'
6    Next steps                  5'
==== =========================== ====

The timing depends on the group and may vary.
If you keep an eye on the clock strictly, you can finish within 90'.
With an engaged group, the entire workshop may last 2 hours easily.

## 1. Welcome

Say hi to the participants and explain the goal of the workshop.
Do not spend more than 2 minutes here, because you want the group to get going fast.

## 2. Data Protection Quiz

You need to have the quiz printed for the participants or a way to give the PDF to online participants.
If you use a print, do not tack the pages together. Do not use two-sided printing.
Use the following order:

* announce the task: complete the quiz as a team
* announce the time limit: 20 minutes is sufficient for most groups
* randomly split the participants into groups of 3-4 people.
* GO!
* inform the participants 5, 2 and 1 minute before time runs out

You might encourage people to move to different rooms to work on the tasks.
If you have a big room, different corners will do.

## 3. Go through answers

Let each team give their answers to another team.
Ask them to mark points.
Go through the quesions one by one.
Ask the participants for suggestions, read out the correct ones.
You can take some time to answer factual questions but do not linger around for discussions.

**when you are done you might want to take a short break, especially in an online setting.**

## 4. Mind Map

To summarize the learnings, display seven fundamental concepts.
Much of GDPR revolves around these:

- personal data
- consent
- right to be forgotten
- data breach
- sensitive data
- data protection officer (DPO)
- data privacy impact assessment (DPIA)

It makes sense to display them as a mind map or write them on a whiteboard/flipchart.
Probably you can make a more beautiful one than this (**Pull Requests appreciated!**):

## 5. Reflection Questions

Conduct a **Lean Coffee** session to discuss a few practical questions.
You find a list of questions below and in the accompanied presentation (for printing!).
Pick a topic, discuss it for five minutes, proceed to the next until you run out of time.

* Pick 10 of the reflection questions below.
* Display them simultaneously. 
* quick vote for priorities (participants may vote on any number of questions)
* discuss a question for 5 minutes
* proceed to the next one or vote to extend by another 5 minutes

## 6. Next steps

To cleanly close the workshop, ask each participant for their impressions and what next steps they would take to improve data protection.

H & M recorded obligatory online meetings of several hundred employees after they returned from vacations or sick leave, the meetings contained details from their private lives 35 M€

Marriott had their customer database hacked, exposing names, addresses and passport numbers of guests 20 M€
